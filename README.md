AngularJS Tablesort
===================

Allow tables to be sorted by clicking their headings.

Background
----------

When you use jquery to build your web-pages, it is very easy to add sorting-functionality to your tables - include [tablesorter](http://tablesorter.com) and annotate your column headings slightly to tell it what type of data your table contains.

The goal with this module is to make it just as easy to add sorting to AngularJS tables, but with proper use of angular features and not jquery.

Click once on a heading to sort ascending, twice for descending. Use shift-click to sort on more than one column.

Additionally, these directives also makes it easy to add a default row that is shown in empty tables to make
it explicit that the table is intentionally empty and not just broken.

Installation
------------

    bower install angular-tablesort

or

    npm install angular-tablesort


Usage
-----

Include the script in your markup

```html
<script src="bower_components/angular-tablesort/js/angular-tablesort.js"></script>
```

Include the module in your app

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['tableSort']);
```

The following code generates a table that can be sorted by clicking on the table headings:

```html
<table border="1" ts-wrapper>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th ts-criteria="Id">Id</th>
      <th ts-criteria="Name|lowercase" ts-default>Name</th>
      <th ts-criteria="Price|parseFloat">Price</th>
      <th ts-criteria="Quantity|parseInt">Quantity</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr ng-repeat="item in items" ts-repeat>
      <td>{{item.Name}}</td>
      <td>{{item.Price | currency}}</td>
      <td>{{item.Quantity}}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

The `ts-wrapper` attribute must be set on element that surrounds both the headings and the ng-repeat statement.

The `ts-criteria` attribute tells tablesort which expression it should sort on when that element is clicked. Normally, the ts-criteria is the same as the expression that is shown in the column, but it doesn't have to be. The ts-criteria can also be filtered using the normal AngularJS filter syntax. Tablesort includes two filters parseInt and parseFloat that use the javascript functions of the same name, but any filter can be used.

The `ts-name` attribute can be set to declare a unique name for an expression which will be used in the event fired when sorting has changed.

The `ts-default` attribute can be set on one or more columns to sort on them in ascending order by default.
To sort in descending order, set ts-default to "descending"

The `ts-repeat` attribute must be set on the element with ng-repeat.

```html
<tr ng-repeat="item in items" ts-repeat>
```

Alternatively, `ts-repeat-start` and `ts-repeat-end` may be used to compliment the `ng-repeat-start` and `ng-repeat-end` directives.

```html
<tr ng-repeat-start="item in items track by item.Id" ts-repeat-start>
  <td><input type="checkbox" ng-model="item.selected"></td>
  <td>{{ item.Name }}</td>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat-end data-ts-repeat-end ng-show="item.selected">
  <td colspan="2">{{ item.Description }}</td>
</tr>
```

By default, the sorting will be done as the last operation in the ng-repeat expression. To override this behavior, use an explicit `tablesort` directive as part of your ng-repeat expression. E.g.

```html
<tr ng-repeat="item in items | limitTo: 10" ts-repeat>
```

This will first select the first 10 items in `items` and then sort them. Alternatively, you can insert an explicit tablesort in the pipe:

```html
<tr ng-repeat="item in items | tablesort | limitTo: 10" ts-repeat>
```

This will first sort the rows according to your specification and then only show the first 10 rows.

If the `ng-repeat` expression contains a `track by` statement (which is generally a good idea), that expression will
be used to provide a [stable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability) sort result.


Events
------

When changing sorting in the table, an event named `tablesort:sortOrder` will be emitted which contains an array of all current sorting definitions.
These sorting definitions could be used to set up sorted data retrieval when using other directives that handle things like pagination or filtering.

```js
$scope.$on('tablesort:sortOrder', (event, sortOrder) => {
  self.sortOrder = sortOrder.map(o => {
   return `${o.name} ${o.order ? 'ASC' : 'DESC'}`;
  });
});
```


CSS
---

All table headings that can be sorted on is styled with css-class `tablesort-sortable`. The table headings that the table is currently sorted on is styled with `tablesort-asc` or `tablesort-desc` classes depending on the sort-direction. A stylesheet is included to show that it works, but you probably want to build your own.

By default the content and look of the data for empty tables is controlled via css. It is inserted as one empty `<td>` spanning
all columns and placed inside a `<tr>` with class `showIfLast` The `<tr>` is placed at the top of each table. 
To disable this feature add the attribute `ts-hide-no-data` to the `ts-repeat` row:
```html
<tr ng-repeat="item in items" ts-repeat ts-hide-no-data>
```
